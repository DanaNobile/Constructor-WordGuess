# Constructor-WordGuess

This is a game between the user and computer. The theme of the game is yoga postures. The computer chooses a posture based on the programmed array of options and displays the number of characters in the form of an underscore. The user then enters single letters to try and fill in the blanks. 
The user has ten guesses. If the user guesses the word, or if the user runs out of guesses, the game prompts the user to decide if they want to play again, or discontinue.
